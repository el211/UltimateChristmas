# Configuration for the Shard Shop GUI
#
# Players do /shards shop to open.
# When they click an item:
#   -> They get a confirmation GUI (YES/NO).
#
# price: cost in shards
# slot: inventory slot in the 6x9 GUI (0-53)
#
# TWO WAYS TO DELIVER THE REWARD:
#
# 1) COMMAND MODE (has "commands:")
#    - Runs each command from console.
#    - "%player%" will be replaced with the player's name.
#
# 2) DIRECT ITEM MODE (NO "commands:")
#    - The plugin builds an ItemStack and gives it directly.
#      Supported keys for direct items:
#        icon                <Material>       (required)
#        display_name        <String>
#        lore                <List<String>>
#        custom_model_data   <int>            (optional)
#        attackdamage        <double>         (optional)
#        attackspeed         <double>         (optional)
#        max_durability      <int>            (optional, damageable items only!)
#
#      - attackdamage / attackspeed become attribute modifiers on MAINHAND
#      - max_durability sets how many "uses left" the item appears to have
#        and is shown in the lore as "Durability: X uses left"
#      - item gets Unbreaking I for the glow, with hidden attributes
#
# NOTE:
# If "commands:" is present, we IGNORE the direct item path entirely.

items:

  # -------------------------------------------------

  #  - will glow (fake unbreaking)
  #  - we also set durability using max_durability
  #
  # max_durability: 42
  #   -> player sees "Durability: 42 uses left"

  # -------------------------------------------------
  # 5) Santa Hat cosmetic
  #    DIRECT ITEM MODE
  #
  # This is armor, so it IS damageable in vanilla.
  # If you want it to be "almost unbreakable" for fun, set max_durability high.
  #
  # We'll still hide attributes and glow it so it's special.
  #
  # If you'd rather it not show a durability line, just remove max_durability.
